# Projects: Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains various projects made with Python / Jupyter Notebooks in order to solve a series of exercises about the basics of Digital Signal Processing.

## How to run:

### Docker:
The best way to run these exercises is to directly download the image from DockerHub:

https://hub.docker.com/r/reborafs/dsp-untref

How to run the image on Ubuntu: 

  '''sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 reborafs/dsp-untref:main'''

The -p tag here is importantâ€”you will need to connect the port that the notebook is running on inside the container with your local machine.
