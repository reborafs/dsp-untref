# Projects: Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains various projects made with Python / Jupyter Notebooks in order to solve a series of exercises about the basics of Digital Signal Processing.

## Running the projects:

The best way to run these exercises is to download the image from DockerHub:

https://hub.docker.com/r/reborafs/dsp-untref

How to run the image on Ubuntu:
  sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 reborafs/dsp-untref:main
The -p tag here is importantâ€”you will need to connect the port that the notebook is running on inside the container with your local machine.
